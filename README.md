# 🚀 My First Web Project: The Solar System Explorer 🪐

Welcome to my very first web development project! I've always been fascinated by space, so I decided to build an interactive page about our Solar System while learning the basics of coding.


## 🌟 About the Project
This is a simple, clean, and educational website that I built from scratch. It's the result of my first steps into the world of web development. My goal was to create a place where you can learn cool facts about planets while I practice my styling and scripting skills.


## 🛠️ What I used (and learned!):
* **HTML**
* **CSS**
* **JavaScript**


## 💡 What's inside?

## 🧠 What I learned during the journey
Building this site wasn't just about code.
* **Patience is a virtue** – Sometimes one missing semicolon can break the whole universe.
* **Design matters** – Choosing the right colors and icons.


## ☄️ Favorite Space Facts in this project
I included some of my favorite trivia on the site, for example:
* **Venus is the hottest planet**, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun! 🌡️
* **One day on Venus** is longer than a whole year on Earth.
* **Jupiter is so big** that all other planets in the solar system could fit inside it.
